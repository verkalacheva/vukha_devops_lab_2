By the help of Hans de Goede a linux compatible version of Mega Mario was created.
To play under linux you have to run the makefile located in the Megamario directory, just type :

> make PREFIX=/usr/local
> make PREFIX=/usr/local install


The libraries 

SDL 
SDL_image 
SDL_mixer 
SDL_ttf 

need to be installed!!!
